  Everyone has a ritual that helps set the tone for the day ahead. Knowing exactly how the first few minutes of your day will look is a tool we can implement that will leave us feeling empowered as we face the rest of our day. It’s important to cultivate this sacred time for yourself and begin each day with intention.
  </p>
  <p>
  Designing a morning that aligns with what feels right for you is imperative, so be sure to create a space that resonates with you rather than simply following a routine that works for someone else. Remember, what works for one person may not work for you, and that’s okay. Some people have extremely detailed mornings and others simply take five minutes to express gratitude for the life they have been given. Whatever you choose is perfect for you and will create a snowball effect of intention and self-honoring choices the rest of your day.

  Looking to begin a morning ritual but still need a little inspiration? Here are some examples of morning rituals to help you get started.

  <p><span class="subhead">Listen to Uplifting Music</span><br>Uplifting music can have a direct impact on our mood, especially in the morning. It charges us emotionally and tunes us into a more positive outlook of the day ahead.

  Most people wake up to music or listen to music as they commute to work.Being more selective and conscious of the music you listen to in the morning can have a great impact on your day and life in general.</p>

  <p><span class="subhead" >Writing Down Your Most Important Tasks</span><br>This is a very practical ritual. Start your day by identifying and writing down from one to three of the most important tasks you need to complete during that day. These tasks are ones which support important long term goals that are aligned to your purpose, passion or general direction in life.</p>
