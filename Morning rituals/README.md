## Challenges faced:
* designing the spot the difference game. Locking upon the strategy took some time.
* adding the locally stored variable
* styling images with the theme took lotsa reading
* Combining so many elements to the page created chaos.

## Improvement needed:
1. Local variable in the todo list item is not functioning proper.
2. UI design can be better and more responsive.
3. Instead of an alert could have used modal for game reactions.
4. Could have designed it to be a multi-page website.
