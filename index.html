  Everyone has a ritual that helps set the tone for the day ahead. Knowing exactly how the first few minutes of your day will look is a tool we can implement that will leave us feeling empowered as we face the rest of our day. It’s important to cultivate this sacred time for yourself and begin each day with intention.
  </p>
  <p>
  Designing a morning that aligns with what feels right for you is imperative, so be sure to create a space that resonates with you rather than simply following a routine that works for someone else. Remember, what works for one person may not work for you, and that’s okay. Some people have extremely detailed mornings and others simply take five minutes to express gratitude for the life they have been given. Whatever you choose is perfect for you and will create a snowball effect of intention and self-honoring choices the rest of your day.
</p>
<p>
  Looking to begin a morning ritual but still need a little inspiration? Here are some examples of morning rituals to help you get started.
</p><br>

<h3>Listen to Uplifting Music</h3>

  <p>Uplifting music can have a direct impact on our mood, especially in the morning. It charges us emotionally and tunes us into a more positive outlook of the day ahead.

  Most people wake up to music or listen to music as they commute to work. Very often, however, they tune in to a radio or randomly pick a playlist from their device. Being more selective and conscious of the music you listen to in the morning can have a great impact on your day and life in general.</p>

<h3>Writing Down Your Most Important Tasks</h3>

  <p>This is a very practical ritual. Start your day by identifying and writing down from one to three of the most important tasks you need to complete during that day. These tasks are ones which support important long term goals that are aligned to your purpose, passion or general direction in life.</p>
</div>



<h3>Affirm Your Goals in Writing or Drawing</h3>

  <p>Writing down your most important tasks of the day is a way to have a concrete structure of action to follow. Affirming your goals, on the other hand, is a very powerful way of crystallizing your vision and goals in life into your everyday mental space.</p>

</div>

<h3>Gratitude</h3>
<div class="hmpage_text_div">

  <p>Feeling gratitude and appreciation for those little signs and moments of joy happening in your life is probably one of the most overlooked or underestimated rituals. It is a perfect morning ritual to start your day on a very positive key.</p>
</div>


<h3>Exercise</h3>
<div class="hmpage_text_div">

  <p>What you do in the morning has an uncanny ability to set you up for the rest of the day, so the energy and vitality you get from exercise is a great thing to do in the morning as it keeps you energized for the entire rest of your day.
